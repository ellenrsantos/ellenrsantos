## Hi there! 😊

I’m a Materials Engineer with a Master’s degree in the field, and I’ve been working as a Data Scientist for the past 4 years. My background combines strong technical training with hands-on experience in analyzing complex datasets, statistical modeling, and developing data-driven solutions.

I have solid experience with tools such as Python, SQL, and key Machine Learning libraries (including Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy), as well as skills in data visualization and communicating insights to diverse audiences. Throughout my career, I’ve transitioned from academic research into the data science world, applying analytical thinking and critical problem-solving to generate strategic insights and support decision-making.

I'm especially interested in projects that combine technology, innovation, and real-world impact—particularly in the areas of industry and applied research.
